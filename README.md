# Fantasy Football Dashboard
This dashboard was designed in Power BI to be able to compare the important metrics when it comes to making selections for a fantasy football team. 

In order for the dashboard to run smoothly, certain metrics of data that were collected had to be left out in order for the dashboard to operate effectively as a one page design. To further this project the metrics that had to be left out could further the development of this dashboard into a multi-page design.
