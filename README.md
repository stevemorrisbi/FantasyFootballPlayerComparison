# Fantasy Football Dashboard
### Overview: Interactive Fantasty Football player comparison tool.

This dashboard was designed in Power BI to be able to compare the important metrics when it comes to making selections for a fantasy football team. 

To meet the brief of creating an interactive one page design, certain metrics of data had to be excluded in order for efficient functionality.

For utility purposes, DAX was incoporated in ensure that if any player is selected, they are then removed from the associated collumn. 

To further this project the KPI's that had to be left out could be utilised in devloping this dashboard into a multi-page design.
